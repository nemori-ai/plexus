/**
 * G1-IN-CONTEXT — the deterministic renderer for the HTTP-ONLY ("in-context") agent integration.
 *
 * SSOT: docs/design/agent-skill-compile-domain-model.md §5 (deliver·P), ADR-8; and
 *       integrations/in-context/PROTOCOL.md (the static pure-HTTP protocol instruction SSOT).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS — the THIRD delivery form, alongside `render-plugin.ts` (Claude Code) and
 * `render-generic.ts` (portable CLI). Where those materialize files on disk, IN-CONTEXT
 * materializes NOTHING: a light / cloud agent with no filesystem gets a pure-HTTP-protocol
 * instruction TEXT (the committed PROTOCOL.md with the gateway URL filled in) that it feeds
 * straight into its own context and follows with its own `fetch`/`curl`. There is no CLI, no
 * plugin, no bootstrap script — hence no public route: the endpoint returns the instruction +
 * the one-time enroll code ONLY in the mgmt-gated JSON.
 *
 * INV III / secret hygiene — the instruction is CODE-FREE + KEY-FREE. It carries no one-time
 * enrollment code, no durable PAT, and no admin connection-key; it references only the bare
 * credential PREFIXES (`plx_agent_…` / `plx_enroll_…` / `plx_live_…`) as protocol markers. The
 * one-time code is delivered SEPARATELY, only in the mgmt-gated JSON (`enrollCode`) — never in the
 * instruction. `assertInContextVerified` enforces this at serve time (shared `secret-denylist.ts`).
 *
 * Unlike the generic renderer there is NO engine to embed (in-context installs nothing), so this
 * module has no engine-SHA pin — only the shared structural + caller-supplied secret scan.
