 * The SHARED structural secret denylist + engine pin — the single oracle both the CC verifier

 * `assertGenericVerified`) enforce. Keeping it in ONE module removes the asymmetry a reviewer
 * flagged: previously the generic path lacked the `plx_live_` connection-key pattern and the
 * engine SHA pin that the CC path had. Not exploitable today, but defense-in-depth must be
 * aligned so neither path can drift below the other.
 *
 * A DURABLE credential = a fixed prefix + a substantial random body. The bare PREFIX strings
 * (`plx_agent_`, `plx_enroll_`) legitimately appear as greppable markers in the engine/prose, so
 * only a prefix followed by a real body (≥16 base64url chars / ≥32 hex) is treated as a baked
 * secret. Matched as patterns so a secret is blocked even when a caller forgets `forbiddenSecrets`.
